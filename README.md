# EZDevice-python

This project is in alpha test - you probably don't want this yet.

# Installation

You can install this package with the pip utility (this project requires python 3):

pip install ezdevice-python

# Programming new devices

This tool _should_ automate the process of installing a ezdevice binary onto a new device. You run it as follows

ezdevice --install BOARDTYPE

Where boardtype is a single letter:

- L for the TTGO T5 with a 2.13" screen
- M for the TTGO T5s
- R for the TTGO T4
- O for the TTGO with a 18650 battery and OLED screen (I'm not sure if this has a model number)

Support for other device types will be released soon.
